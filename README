This is a prototype for a multi-process port scanner I wrote between 1998
and 1999. I'm putting this on Github only for my own archival purposes,
I belive today it is of no interest at all.

Original README follows:

rascan is a SYN/FIN port scanner. It is very fast and isn't totally
"automatic" (as for exaple namp[2]), it asks for timeout and is a lot
verbose.  Now it works only under linux and is bad coded. See CHANGES
file if you want to know next developing goals. rascan is copyright (C) 1999
by Salvatore Sanfilippo and comes under GPL version 2 of license.
