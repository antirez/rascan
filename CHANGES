Nov 4 1999	After 8 months I come back to mantain and develop rascan.
		Current status: a SYN/FIN port scanner in a single C file,
		only per linux, very very fast with a nice option to scan
		a specific port of a C class in some second. The first goal
		is to obtain a more portable software splitted in more than
		one C file and to recode some part that are very dirty.
